This project uses CMU's Reinforcement Learning Simulator to run the experiments. The original source can be found here:
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awm/rlsim/

The compiled RLSim jar is included in my submission, along with the source.

To run RL_Sim, cd into 'RL_sim' and run:
'java -jar rl_sim.jar'

The mazes I used for my experiments are:
Small map: small.maze
Large Map: large.maze

From there, you can choose the algorithm you want to run and load the maze files in the GUI.

The pictures I used in my analysis as well as other expeirments can be found in the 'Data' folder.
