The datasets I've used for my project are downloaded and included in my submission, but their original links can be found here:

Human Resources Analytics(HR)

Handwriting Verification(HV)

I used python 2.7 to run all of the algorithms along with scikit-learn, numpy, and matplotlib, pybrain.
To run any of the algorithms, run the command
$ python experiments.py

To run any one particular experiment or dataset, you can comment the methods out at the bottom of the file in the "__main__" function. All the graphs produced by the experiment will be saved into the 'dataplots' folder.
