The datasets I've used for my project are downloaded and included in my submission, but their original links can be found here:

Handwriting Verification(HV)
https://www.kaggle.com/anupamwadhwa/handwriting-verification/data

Human Resources Analytics(HR)
https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics/data

I used python 2.7 to run all of the algorithms along with scikit-learn, numpy, and matplotlib.
To run any of the algorithms, run the command
$ python HR_DecisionTree.py
for the appropriate dataset/algorithm.
